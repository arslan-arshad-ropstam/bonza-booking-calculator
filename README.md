# Bonza Booking Calculator Plugin

A WordPress plugin that provides a booking cost calculator via the `[booking_quote]` shortcode. Users can input their name, address, distance (in km), and number of rooms (1â€“5) to get an estimated booking cost based on the formula: $100 base + $10 per km + $50 per room. Form submissions are saved to a custom database table.

## Installation

1. Download the plugin as a ZIP file or clone the repository.
2. Upload the `bonza-booking-calculator` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
4. Add the `[booking_quote]` shortcode to any page or post to display the booking form.
